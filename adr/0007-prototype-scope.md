# ADR 0007: Prototype Scope — Operator-Driven Dumb Renderer

## Status

**Proposed** (2026-06-18) — **operator approved in-session 2026-06-18**;
formal ratification batched with ADR 0006 (Event Hubs) in the next inbox
sweep, since this ADR presumes the Event Hubs surface. Scopes the first
build (the dogfood prototype, Gate G1a in `planning/workstreams.md`).
Operator-gated. Refines ADR 0004 (content-API MVP) and ADR 0006 (Event
Hubs) into a concrete buildable prototype; defers a set of features
explicitly rather than leaving them as open gaps.

## Context

Validation round 1 returned CONDITIONAL (learning-lab GO). The operator
fixed the prototype's shape: a **dumb UI**, with the operator acting as the
intelligence via Claude Code, pushing curated content to a cloud-hosted DB
through the content API, viewed on native mobile clients. A bootstrap review
surfaced gaps (push, auth, roles, Hub permissions, native calendar) — most
of which are **out of scope for this prototype by design**, not omissions.
This ADR records the boundary so the planning loop builds exactly the
prototype and nothing more.

## Decision

**The prototype is an operator-driven dumb renderer.**

**In scope:**
1. **Cloud-hosted DB + content API** — the app owns the rendered data
   (ADR 0006). Idempotent upsert for briefing cards and
   Hub/Section/Block (schema is the contract).
2. **Claude Code push skill / CLI** — the operator's authoring loop; the
   primary dogfood + learning artifact. The "intelligence" lives here, not
   in the app.
3. **Two render surfaces** — "Now" (briefing cards) and "Hubs" (Event Hub
   dossiers), co-equal (ADR 0006).
4. **In-app tap-through** — card → hub/block routing via internal
   navigation (NOT Universal/App Links yet).
5. **Native Android + iOS clients via Compose Multiplatform** (one Kotlin
   codebase → both native apps). **Web is out of prototype scope.**
6. **Minimal auth** — a single household API token so the DB isn't open. No
   login UX, no multi-member identity.

**Out of scope (deferred by design, each its own future ADR/spec when
revisited):**
- Push notifications / FCM / APNs (pull-to-view only). [was review gap G1]
- Multi-member login, household tenancy, roles. [G2]
- Per-Hub / per-member visibility & permissions. [G3]
- In-app authoring or any app-side intelligence/curation. [G4 — this is the
  deliberate bet: the operator + Claude Code are the brain]
- Any data-source integration — Google Calendar API, native EventKit/
  CalendarContract, Gmail, weather, Instacart/commerce. Calendar-derived
  content is simply pushed by the operator. [N4]
- Universal Links / App Links + domain-association files. [N1/N2]
- Home-screen widgets. [N5]
- Document upload/storage (links + small refs only, per ADR 0006).
- 14+ minor accounts (ADR 0005) — prototype is operator/adult only.

## Rationale

This is the cheapest path to daily dogfood value and maximal learning
(content-API + Claude-authoring loop + CMP native rendering), and it dodges
every fatal wall validation found: no OAuth, no push cost, no COPPA surface,
no CASA, no integrations, no web. Every deferred item is additive later
without rework, because the content API + render split is the stable spine.
The dumb-renderer choice makes "render, don't reason" literal.

**Rejected:** building any integration, auth, or push into the prototype —
rejected as premature cost/risk before the operator has even confirmed daily
personal value or swept the inbox kill-checks.

## Consequences

Positive: buildable now by a solo dev in weeks; learning-complete regardless
of business outcome; clean deferral list instead of ambiguous gaps.
Negative: the prototype proves operator value + the authoring ergonomics,
NOT willingness-to-pay or multi-user dynamics (consistent with the
learning-lab framing; the skeptic's "dogfood proves enthusiasm not WTP"
point stands and is accepted). iOS device deploy needs an Apple account
(free 7-day re-sign or $99/yr stable) — the one unavoidable native friction.

## Revisit Trigger

Prototype in daily operator use → decide which deferred item earns the next
build (likely: a second household → forces auth G2 + visibility G3; or
integrations → forces N4 + the restricted-scope/COPPA ADRs). Each deferred
item re-enters via its own ADR/spec.
