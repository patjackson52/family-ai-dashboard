# Decisions Index

Index of decision records. The ADRs themselves live in `adr/`. Once
accepted, an ADR is immutable — supersede it with a new ADR rather than
editing it.

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 0000 | ADR Template | Template |
| 0001 | Repo Markdown as Source of Truth; Memory Systems as Working Memory | Accepted 2026-06-18 |
| 0002 | Execution & Tracking Model — Phase-Gated, Agent-Operated, Operator-Escalated | Accepted 2026-06-18 |
| 0003 | Planning-Loop Operating Model — Autonomous Waterfall Deepening with Confidence-Gated Decisions | Accepted 2026-06-18 |
| 0004 | Product Framing — Calm Family Briefing Surface, Content-API-Fed, Adults-Only MVP | Accepted 2026-06-18 (adults-only clause: supersession proposed in 0005) |
| 0005 | Minor Accounts (14+) Permitted at MVP, No Email Integration for Minor Profiles | Proposed 2026-06-18 (operator-gated; pending counsel) |
| 0006 | Event Hubs — Co-Equal Curated-Dossier Surface, App-Owned, Push-Curated | Accepted 2026-06-18 |
| 0007 | Prototype Scope — Operator-Driven Dumb Renderer | Accepted 2026-06-18 |
| 0008 | Design-First — Hi-Fi UI/UX Mockups Precede Deep Planning and Build | Accepted 2026-06-18 |
| 0009 | Design System — Material 3 Expressive, Adaptive, Compose | Accepted 2026-06-18 |
| 0010 | Auth & Family-Tenancy Architecture (Firebase Auth, M:N membership, RFC 8628 device grant) | **Superseded by 0011** (2026-06-18) |
| 0011 | Auth & Family-Tenancy Architecture (Hardened) | Accepted 2026-06-18 (supersedes 0010; post-5-agent-review) |
| 0012 | Agent-Operated Build & Deploy — Autonomy Boundaries | Accepted 2026-06-18 (operator-set: full prod autonomy + safety rails, budget cap, browser-after-login) |
| 0013 | Client Architecture — KMP/CMP Shared UI + redux-kotlin 1.0.0-alpha1 | Accepted 2026-06-18. **Build pin → `1.0.0-alpha01`** (INB-11 superseded 2026-06-19: operator owns/maintains reduxkotlin, so alpha-churn risk is moot; directive: latest APIs + `f(store.state)→UI`). All modules on Kotlin 2.3.20; `store.selectorState{}` (f(store.state)→UI) + devtools wired + verified on Pixel/emulator. |
| 0014 | Private On-Device Trigger Engine (geo/time/activity) | Accepted 2026-06-18 (triggers=metadata; device matches locally; live position never leaves) |
| 0015 | End-to-End Encryption | **Proposed — scoped to M1** (INB-10: M0 = PLAINTEXT; live E2EE is an M1 option gated by ADR 0017) |
| 0016 | Two-Way Interactive Pull-Loop (reserved, bounded-now) | **Proposed** 2026-06-18 (additive; reasoning stays in the key-holding loop; reserved actions[]/intents) |
| 0017 | E2E Key-Authenticity + Deploy Trust-Root Boundary | **Proposed** 2026-06-18 (M1 security gate; from the 6-agent review — fake-key MITM + trust-root concentration) |
| 0018 | API Host — TypeScript on Vercel | Accepted 2026-06-18 (INB-9; CLI/client stay Kotlin; types codegen from schema; Postgres via pooler) |
| 0019 | Client Observability & Tooling (devtools/snapshots/CLI) | **Accepted** 2026-06-19 (operator-directed) — redux-kotlin-devtools enhancer + in-app drawer LIVE (verified on-device) + Compose snapshots; golden-diff/remote/CLI remaining |
| 0020 | Offline-First Client Data + Freshness (DB-as-source-of-truth) | **Proposed** 2026-06-19 — network→DB(SQLDelight)→store→UI unidirectional; instant offline cold-start; foreground poll ~30–60s (push later); background WorkManager/BGTask. Build slice pending (shipped client is in-memory) |
| 0021 | Auth Pulled Into Active Build — S1–S6 Decomposition + Dev-Token Posture | **Accepted** 2026-06-19 (extends 0011; re-confirms its sequencing trigger). Build order S1→S3→S2→S4→(S5,S6); non-breaking household-token coexistence (cutover at S3); dev-token local-only. S1 build in progress. |
