// Pure back-navigation model (predictive back, Core P0). System back ("up one
// level") is a function of state: an OPEN OVERLAY closes first; otherwise it
// resolves to an existing nav action, or null when the app should NOT consume back
// (an auth-gate / top-level screen → the OS handles it, e.g. back-to-home). The
// reducer's `is Back ->` delegates here; the shell BackHandler enables itself via
// appHandlesBack(). One source of truth.
//
// NOTE: this is reducer-pure. One route has an extra side effect on back that the
// reducer cannot express — Route.Hubs detail also cancels the HubEngine DB tree
// subscription via onCloseHub() (FeedApp HubsHost). The shell BackHandler special-
// cases CloseHub to run that closure; see Task 4. Everything else is dispatch-only.
