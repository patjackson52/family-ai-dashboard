// ADR 0038 §6 / 0039 — the outbox sender state machine, as a PURE function so the
// egress path is testable headlessly (no network, no DB). The sender loop in SyncEngine
// drains the outbox FIFO and feeds each attempt's HTTP result here to decide what's next.
//
// Lifecycle of an op: pending → inflight → { acked (200) → drop on echo | failed | dropped }.
// Outcomes:
//   Acked   (200)            — store the returned version; mark acked; the row is deleted
//                              when /sync echoes a block at ≥ that version (echo-suppress on op_id).
//   ReMerge (412)            — the base version was stale; re-fetch, re-run merge(), re-enqueue.
//   Drop    (410/404/4xx)    — the target is gone or the request is malformed → give up, remove op.
//   Backoff (401/5xx/network)— transient; retry later with exponential backoff.
//   Failed  (cap reached)    — surfaced calmly ("couldn't save — will retry on next sync");
//                              the op stays for a later manual/foreground retry.
