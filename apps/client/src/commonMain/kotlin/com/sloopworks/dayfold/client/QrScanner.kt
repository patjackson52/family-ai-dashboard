// AUTH-S6-D Phase 2 — in-app QR scanner seam (expect/actual).
//
// [qrScanSupported] gates the scan affordance: the EnterCode Scan/Type toggle and
// the scan routes only appear where a camera + decoder exist. Desktop = false.
// Android/iOS return false UNTIL their camera actuals land (Tier 2: CameraX + ML
// Kit barcode on Android; AVFoundation via UIKitView on iOS) — so this slice
// ships the full scan UI + flow, snapshot-verified, with the camera as the one
// remaining device-gated piece. No camera dependencies are pulled here.

// Renders the live camera preview and calls [onCode] with the raw decoded payload
// (the verification_uri_complete URL, or a bare code). The caller parses it with
// parseDeviceCode and drives lookupDevice. [onCancel] = the user backed out (or the
// platform couldn't start the camera). Hosted behind the ScanDevice overlay chrome.
