- **INB-24 · ANSWERED 2026-06-26 → Hub/card visual-enrichment BUILD gates CLEARED.**
  Operator (in-session): (1) **ADR 0008 hi-fi signoff = "Approve as-is"** on the
  imported `designs/hub-card-enrichment/` mockup (Enrichment + Hub-Enrichment-Phone +
  support.js) — clears the design-first gate for the enrichment surfaces. (2)
  **ADR 0036 = "Accept — Wikimedia-only start"** → flipped Proposed→Accepted;
  Phase-1 image-URL allowlist = exactly `upload.wikimedia.org`; hardened shared
  validator (https-only, reject userinfo/punycode/alt-port/suffix/SVG) server+client+CLI;
  client→third-party IP/usage leak accepted as explicitly-temporary (Phase 2 self-host
  kills it). Build proceeds: schema+codegen → migration 0012 → validator → Coil3 render →
  CLI/skill → tests. Spec: `specs/hub-card-visual-enrichment-design.md`.

- **INB-23 · ANSWERED 2026-06-26 → ADR 0034 ACCEPTED.** Operator "inb 23 approved" →
  ADR 0034 flipped Proposed→Accepted; **G5 posture ratified** (all tracks→prod Vercel
  API, real sign-in AUTH-S3, never bake `HOUSEHOLD_SECRET`/`DEV_AUTH_SECRET`). The
  remaining **G1–G4 are one-time operator setup actions** to switch the (merged, inert)
  pipeline live — recommended order G1+G3 first (keystore + Play account) so merges
  auto-ship to `internal`, then G2 (real Firebase) before relying on Google sign-in, G4
  before a real beta. Runbook: `processes/mobile-release.md`. Original below.

  **Mobile release pipeline: one-time store gates
  (ADR 0034).** The 3-track Android pipeline is built + merged
  (`release-android.yml` + signing/versioning + a CI compile smoke) and **inert until**
  these operator-only gates are done (secrets / accounts / spend / store listing).
  Runbook: `processes/mobile-release.md`. **Proposed default: do G1+G3 first** (keystore +
  Play account) so merges auto-ship to the `internal` track; defer G4 until closer to a
  real beta.
  - **G1** generate the upload keystore (+ opt into Play App Signing) → 4 secrets.
  - **G2** real Firebase `google-services.json` → `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_BASE64` (else
    Google sign-in is dead in store builds).
  - **G3** Play Console + service account ($25 one-time — **spend**); first AAB uploaded
    by hand → `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.
  - **G4** store listing + **data-safety form** (intersects children's-data / restricted-
    scope guardrails — review carefully).
  - **G5** confirm: all tracks → prod Vercel API (no staging), real sign-in (AUTH-S3),
    **never bake `HOUSEHOLD_SECRET`/`DEV_AUTH_SECRET`** into a store build.
  - Also **accept/flip ADR 0034** (Proposed → Accepted) — platform/vendor + external
    publishing + spend, so it's operator-gated.

- **INB-22 · ANSWERED 2026-06-24 → SIGNED OFF (ADR 0008 hub-visibility delta).**
  Operator signed off the per-member visibility treatment on the Hubs surface
  (`designs/Family AI dashboard design brief/designs/Hubs-Visibility.dc.html`):
  restricted-hub list marker + audience, the detail visibility chip + honesty chip,
  and the "Who can see this hub" sheet (author always permitted, **owner NOT
  auto-permitted** per ADR 0030 option A; "removing someone hides it on next sync").
  Reuses the signed-off Dayfold M3 tokens verbatim; light + dark. **This closes the
  last hub-render design gap** — the Hubs phone surface (INB-15/16) + content
  adaptive two-pane (INB-20) + this visibility delta are now all signed off, so the
  ADR 0008 gate for hub render is **cleared**. Enforcement already built (ADR
  0029/0030, PRs #34/#35). Original: author the ADR-0030 visibility delta the
  2026-06-19 hub mockups predated.

- **INB-21 · ANSWERED 2026-06-23 → ADR 0030 ACCEPTED.** (1) Accepted; (2)
  owner-visibility default = **A (owner NOT auto-permitted)**; (3) card-vs-hub
  posture = **A (author-trusted at MVP)**. Both match the ADR as written → accepted
  unchanged; status flipped to Accepted, index + open-questions reconciled,
  `[pending-ratify]` cleared. Build (content-API + CLI-verbs slice) carries:
  hub `visibility`/`created_by` + hubs-only `resource_visibility` + the
  `→hubs.updated_at` touch-trigger + `briefing_cards.visibility`/`audience[]` +
  the read-path filter + visibility-aware `/sync` (two revocation paths) + client
  cache-wipe on tenancy 401/404. Original below.
  **Accept ADR 0030 (per-member visibility) +
  pick the owner-visibility default.** Schema/scope review produced: **ADR 0030**
  (`adr/0030-per-member-hub-and-card-visibility.md`, Proposed), the consolidated
  **scope & access spec** (`specs/domain-model/scope-and-access-model.md`), and
  the **MVP feature boundary** (`specs/mvp-feature-boundary.md`). Your in-session
  answers are baked in: per-hub visibility IN at MVP; Hub→Now emission stays manual
  (Claude skill authors imminent-item cards); retention = soft-delete + manual
  hard-purge tool. **Two things need you:** (1) **Accept/amend ADR 0030** (it's
  ADR-class — scope + access posture; agents draft, you accept). (2) **Pick the
  owner-visibility default (values-shaped, OQ-owner-visibility-default):** owner
  **NOT** auto-permitted on `restricted` content (proposed — protects co-parent/
  eldercare privacy; owner reads only by authoring or being allow-listed) **vs**
  owner-sees-all (transparent household). One-line filter difference; gates ADR
  0030 → Accepted. **Proposed default:** accept ADR 0030 as written (owner NOT
  auto-permitted). **(3) Ratify the round-2 posture change `[pending-ratify]`:**
  card-level visibility was simplified — cards no longer inherit/materialize hub
  visibility; the trusted skill stamps a flat `audience[]` on the ephemeral cards
  it emits, so "a card can't out-expose its hub" is **author-trusted at MVP, not
  server-enforced** (re-adding server enforcement is the documented Revisit Trigger
  when multi-author/in-app authoring lands). Correct for a single-operator dogfood;
  flagged because it's a real posture move. **Both adversarial review rounds are
  done** (round-1 correctness fixed two P0 sync-revocation holes + author-identity;
  round-2 cut the card machinery, `resource_type` polymorphism, card `created_by`,
  and downgraded the purge tool to operator-SQL-deferred). Remaining build:
  content-API + CLI-verbs slice lands hub render + ADR 0029 scopes + ADR 0030 hub
  visibility + the touch-trigger + visibility-aware `/sync` together.

- **INB-20 · ANSWERED 2026-06-22 → SIGNED OFF + scope accepted + spike OK'd.**
  Operator: (1) adaptive visuals approved; (2) added scope accepted — CL-NAV +
  the CL-1/5/6/8/10 deltas + the `hubRef`/parent-membership field on the content
  item; (3) `material3-adaptive` / `adaptive-navigation-suite` 1.9.3-availability
  spike authorized (runs before CL-NAV commits; fallback if not published for
  Compose-MP 1.9.3). ADR 0008 adaptive gate CLEARED. Original:
  **Sign off the adaptive two-pane design +
  confirm its added scope.** The CL-10 design pass is **delivered + imported**
  (`designs/content/adaptive/` — Breakpoints, Detail-Pane(+View), States,
  Nav-Continuity). It resolves the ADR 0008 adaptive gate (pending your sign-off)
  but **adds scope** the epic now reflects: (a) a **second transition motion**
  (shared-axis fade-through for in-pane card-switching, on top of CL-7's container
  transform); (b) a **selected-card state** in the list pane (→ CL-5); (c) a
  **third "supporting" pane** at expanded showing the **parent Hub + siblings** →
  needs a **`hubRef` on the content item** (→ CL-1/CL-8) and relocates RELATED out
  of the detail at expanded (→ CL-6); (d) **size-class-aware detail** (→ CL-6);
  (e) a new **CL-NAV** shell task + **new adaptive Compose deps** (`material3-
  adaptive` / `adaptive-navigation-suite`) whose **1.9.3 availability needs a
  spike**. Honesty/M0 constraints preserved (RSVP display-only, on-device privacy
  copy). **Proposed default:** sign off the adaptive mockups; accept the added
  scope (CL-NAV + the CL-1/5/6/8/10 deltas in the epic). Visual taste = operator;
  the schema/dep deltas are agent-buildable once accepted.

- **INB-19 · ANSWERED 2026-06-22 → PARTIAL: (1) rk RATIFIED + (2) PINNED
  alpha02 (operator). (3) publish `redux-kotlin-snapshot` + Homebrew-tap
  symlink fix STILL PENDING — both operator-only (external action on the
  operator's own packages; agents draft-not-send).** Recorded as
  **ADR-0019-realized** (no new ADR; tooling/maintenance class). Urgency
  reframed low→**med**: the "before CL-5/6/7 commit" gate is overtaken —
  those merged *without* the golden harness (current = hand-rolled
  `FeedSnapshotTest`, no diff). Real next consumer = **CL-NAV/CL-10
  adaptive** (resize/hinge/pane reflow = visual-regression-sensitive) →
  **hold CL-NAV/CL-10 build until the harness lands.** Agent-buildable once
  (3) ships: `:client:snapshotUi` scene registry + CI golden job (stub
  prepared). Original below.
  **Ratify `rk` as the client dev+CI snapshot/
  devtools toolchain + pin.** The redux-kotlin CLI is now published (Homebrew
  `reduxkotlin/tap/rk` **1.0.0-alpha02**, unified devtools+snapshot). Incorporated
  into `processes/agent-dev-loop.md` + epic task **CL-SNAP** (rk snapshot golden-
  diff CI + rk devtools bridge) — this realizes ADR 0019's deferred golden-diff +
  CLI items. **Two caveats:** (a) it's **alpha** → pin like the redux-kotlin alpha
  bet; (b) `redux-kotlin-snapshot` (the app-side scene dep) is **not yet on Maven
  Central** per the docs — you own reduxkotlin, so confirm/publish the coordinate
  before CL-5/6/7 commit to it. **Also: the Homebrew formula symlink is broken**
  (keg `bin/` empty; binary at `…/libexec/Contents/MacOS/rk`; formula points at
  `libexec/rk.app/…`) — worth a fix in `reduxkotlin/homebrew-tap`. **Proposed
  default:** ratify rk as the toolchain, pin alpha02, publish `redux-kotlin-
  snapshot`. Tooling/maintenance = mild ADR-class; note as ADR-0019-realized.

- **INB-15 · ANSWERED 2026-06-19 → ADR 0022 ACCEPTED; D2 = extend in place.**
  Accepted the typed content library / fold gesture / Dayfold theme. **D2 fork =
  extend `briefing_cards` (type+payload+detail cols)**; unify into `content_item`
  deferred to M1 (migrate with E2EE). Build tasks unblocked; index updated to
  Accepted.

- **INB-16 · ANSWERED 2026-06-19 → Phone mockups SIGNED OFF; adaptive queued.**
  `Content-Library`, `Detail-Phone`, `Tap-To-Detail`, `Brand` approved → ADR 0008
  gate cleared for phone surfaces (CL-0…CL-7 may build). **Queued:** a Claude-
  Design pass for the adaptive two-pane detail (CL-10 stays blocked on it).

- **INB-17 · ANSWERED 2026-06-19 → "Dayfold" confirmed** as the product name
  (repo slug stays `family-ai-dashboard`). CL-0 theme + brand copy proceed under
  Dayfold. Product-naming decision recorded; fold into ADR 0022 D5 on accept.

- **INB-18 · ANSWERED 2026-06-19 → M0 ships ALL 6 content types.** Operator
  widened the review's recommended 2-type (file+invite) slice for full-surface
  coverage sooner. Build order stays CL-0→CL-1(spike, 6 payloads)→CL-2(extend)→
  CL-4→CL-5(6 cards)→CL-6→CL-7(base transition); CL-3/8/9-realmaps/10 deferred.

- **INB-9 · ANSWERED 2026-06-18 → TypeScript on Vercel** (ADR 0018). CLI/client stay Kotlin; types codegen from schema; Postgres via pooler. **Last P0 gate cleared.**

- **INB-9 (orig) · Ratify API host = TypeScript/Vercel.**
  Spec-build loop (architecture review) recommends the backend API in
  **TypeScript on Vercel** (preserves the ADR 0012 preview→promote→rollback
  deploy-autonomy rail; a JVM API needs a container host + standing cost vs
  the <$50/mo cap). **CLI stays Kotlin**; types codegen'd from the JSON
  schema. Platform choice = ADR-class. **Proposed default:** ratify at C3 as
  an ADR. Confirm or pick Kotlin/JVM + Cloud Run instead.

- **INB-11 · SUPERSEDED 2026-06-19 → use `1.0.0-alpha01` (the latest).** The
  operator **owns/maintains reduxkotlin** and will keep it updated, so the
  alpha-churn risk that drove the 0.6.2 default doesn't apply. New directive:
  **leverage the latest APIs** (`concurrentStore`, devtools, the reduxkotlin
  CLI, screenshot tooling) and architect the clients as **`f(store.state) →
  UI`** — the store is the single state source. Verified: both Kotlin modules
  build + test + render on the Pixel on alpha01. (Was: 2026-06-18 → 0.6.2.)
- **INB-10 · ANSWERED 2026-06-18 → M0 = PLAINTEXT** (live E2EE = M1 option, gated by ADR 0017). Schema freeze unblocked.
- *(review decisions 2026-06-18: M0 = briefing-feed-only [Hubs→next slice]; planning-loop ritual suspended for the solo M0 build — keep spec-gate + inbox + multi-agent reviews.)*

- **INB-11 (orig) · redux-kotlin: alpha01 or 0.6.2 stable?**
  You chose `1.0.0-alpha1` (ADR 0013). Verified: it exists (exact
  `1.0.0-alpha01`, all modules, KMP), but it's ~1-day-old (pub 2026-06-17) with
  two alpha01-only modules. **Proposed default:** build P3 on **`0.6.2` stable**
  (hand-written root reducer + `selectorState`/`select{}`) and adopt alpha01
  behind a feature flag once it matures — no hard block either way, and code
  calls `fieldState` (not `fieldStateOf`). Confirm stable-default / insist on
  alpha01.

- **INB-10 · RESOLVED 2026-06-18 → M0 = PLAINTEXT; live E2E = M1 option gated by ADR 0017 (see ANSWERED INB-10 above). Original prompt:**
  Investigation (`research/e2e-encryption-investigation.md`) verdict:
  **CONDITIONAL GO** — the dumb-store architecture makes E2EE nearly free;
  encrypt at M0, distribute keys at M1 (per-member X25519 wrap mapping onto
  owner-approve). **Why high/now:** it changes the **M0 schema** (content
  columns become ciphertext, drop the server FTS index) — cheap to lock before
  real data, expensive to retrofit. Trade-off: loses server-side search;
  **lost keys = lost data** (recovery = OS keychain + owner-mediated re-grant +
  owner recovery phrase, no server escrow — this is **values-shaped, your
  call**). **Proposed default:** accept ADR 0015 → next loop iterations adjust
  02/05/06/08 specs for the encrypted column split. Accept / amend recovery
  posture / defer.

- **INB-15 · 2026-06-19 · med · open — reduxkotlin 1.0 feedback (you maintain it).**
  Findings from wiring `1.0.0-alpha01` into the app →
  `research/reduxkotlin-1.0-feedback.md`. Headline **P0: `redux-kotlin-compose`
  doesn't pull `redux-kotlin-granular` transitively** (GMM variant misses it,
  though the POM declares it) → `FieldStateKt` (selectorState/fieldState) fails
  to load → bare "unresolved reference". Also: compose needs Kotlin ≥2.3.x while
  core/threadsafe read from 2.2.x; selectorState/fieldState are extensions
  (top-level call = "unresolved"); and `concurrentStore`/CLI aren't on Maven Central yet. **DevTools IS published
  (1.0.0-alpha01) — now wired + verified on-device (ADR 0019).** Doc has the
  full list + severities for 1.0.0; `DevTools.md` text predates the publish.

- **INB-14 · DONE 2026-06-19 → Android SDK + Pixel 10 Pro + emulators working; G1a met on-device (feed renders from cloud). iOS shell still needs your Mac. (Was: P3 device-render shell.)**
  The client CORE is built + tested (redux-kotlin 0.6.2 store + /sync reducer,
  5 tests green). What remains to literally "see the feed on your phone" needs
  hardware agents can't supply:
  1. **Android:** the Android SDK + an emulator/device to build & run the
     Compose app (agent can install the SDK; *seeing* it needs a device or your
     OK to run an emulator).
  2. **iOS:** your **Mac + Xcode + Apple Developer** account (P-1) — agents
     can't build/sign iOS.
  The loop will next add a **Compose Desktop** preview of the same feed (builds
  headlessly, no SDK) to prove the render path while the phone targets wait on
  you. Tell me: install the Android SDK + run an emulator now, or hold for your
  device?

- **INB-13 · 2026-06-18 · med · open — Trigger designs need a v2 pass (Claude Design).**
  The new trigger/place/notification mockups are complete (14.5/15) + calm, but
  the 3-agent review found a **P0 honesty bug**: the Places/affordance copy says
  saved place coords "never leave the device" — false per ADR 0014 (they're
  encrypted server-side family content; only *live position* stays local). Fix
  list is in `designs/DESIGN-BRIEF-triggers.md §6b` (privacy copy + the four
  M3-Expressive signatures + offline screen + geo=M1 labeling). **Hand §6b back
  to Claude Design before the trigger surface (M1) gates (ADR 0008).** Schema
  side (`Place.kind`) already fixed.

- **INB-12 · DONE 2026-06-19 → Vercel + Neon created; M0 API deployed live at `family-ai-dashboard.vercel.app` (verified). (Was: P-1 operator bootstrap.)**
  The build loop is running; these account/auth steps only you can do (ADR
  0012 — agents can provision *within* an authed account, but not create the
  account/billing/domain):
  1. **Vercel** — create/auth the project + org (for the MCP deploy rail).
  2. **Postgres** — create a **Neon** (or Supabase) project + billing; put the
     pooled connection string into Vercel's secret store. (Neon serverless
     driver, per ADR 0018.)
  3. **Domain** `api.<host>` DNS (operator-owned) — optional at first (use the
     `*.vercel.app` URL to start).
  4. **Apple** Developer account + a **Mac** (for the iOS client — see INB-14).
  **The deploy config now exists** (`apps/api/vercel.json` + `api/index.ts` Hono
  handler; `pg` talks to Neon's **transaction-pooler** endpoint, no driver
  swap). Once you do the above, deploy is ~3 steps:
  - `npm i -g vercel && vercel link` (in `apps/api`), set env **DATABASE_URL** =
    the Neon **pooled** connection string, **HOUSEHOLD_SECRET** + **HOUSEHOLD_
    CREDENTIAL_ID** (from `node scripts/provision.mjs` run against the Neon DB
    after applying `migrations/0001_m0_init.sql`).
  - `vercel deploy` (preview) → smoke-test `PUT/GET /sync` → `vercel promote`.
  - point the CLI/client `DAYFOLD_API` at the deploy URL.
  *(First-deploy unknown to verify: Vercel bundling the `.ts`-extension imports —
  if it balks, add a tiny build step; the app itself is fully CI-tested.)*
  Reply when Vercel + Neon exist and the loop wires/verifies the live deploy.

- **INB-3 · 2026-06-18 · med · open — Cheapest kill-checks (you, ~2 hrs).**
  Before/while building: (a) run Gemini Daily Brief's school-email→family-
  digest flow yourself; (b) use Maple+ a bit and name what it can't do for a
  niche. These most cheaply move the verdict (KS-6 / OQ-niche). **Operator
  action — cannot be agent-run.** Report findings into A1.
