# Operator Inbox

Questions and ratifications awaiting the operator. Swept weekly (per
`context/values-and-direction.md`). Nothing auto-applies; items aging >2
sweeps escalate in the digest. Newest first.

Format: `INB-N · date · urgency(high/med/low) · status(open/answered/stale)`
Each item: question, context link, **proposed default**, urgency.

- **INB-9 · 2026-06-18 · med · open — Ratify API host = TypeScript/Vercel.**
  Spec-build loop (architecture review) recommends the backend API in
  **TypeScript on Vercel** (preserves the ADR 0012 preview→promote→rollback
  deploy-autonomy rail; a JVM API needs a container host + standing cost vs
  the <$50/mo cap). **CLI stays Kotlin**; types codegen'd from the JSON
  schema. Platform choice = ADR-class. **Proposed default:** ratify at C3 as
  an ADR. Confirm or pick Kotlin/JVM + Cloud Run instead.

- **INB-3 · 2026-06-18 · med · open — Cheapest kill-checks (you, ~2 hrs).**
  Before/while building: (a) run Gemini Daily Brief's school-email→family-
  digest flow yourself; (b) use Maple+ a bit and name what it can't do for a
  niche. These most cheaply move the verdict (KS-6 / OQ-niche). **Operator
  action — cannot be agent-run.** Report findings into A1.

## Answered

- **INB-8 · answered 2026-06-18** — Ratify ADR 0007 + 0006. **→ Accepted
  both** (sweep). Prototype scope locked.
- **INB-7 · answered 2026-06-18** — ADR 0006 (Event Hubs). **→ Accepted.**
  Design cleared to become binding spec at C1b.
- **INB-6 · answered 2026-06-18** — ADR 0005 (14+ minor accounts).
  **→ Direction ratified, ADR stays Proposed pending counsel** on the
  age-gate mechanism + Maryland Kids Code DPIA trigger (legal = never
  agent-decided, guardrail #1). Adults-only remains in force until counsel
  confirms.
- **INB-5 · answered 2026-06-18** — Loop start. **→ Confirmed**, but the
  immediate next item is now **A8 (hi-fi mockups, ADR 0008)**, which gates
  A3. Loop iteration 1 = A8.
- **INB-4 · answered 2026-06-18** — Pricing direction. **→ Acknowledged;
  deferred to B6** (lean annual ~$39-59/yr when set).
- **INB-2 · answered 2026-06-18** — MVP scope guardrails. **→ Ratified**
  (adults-only / no-Gmail-OAuth / plain deep-links; ADR 0004 + 0007).
- **INB-1 · answered 2026-06-18** — Validation verdict & direction.
  **→ Accepted:** proceed building the dogfood prototype as a learning
  artifact; business path stays NO-GO until a flip-condition/niche is
  evidenced.
