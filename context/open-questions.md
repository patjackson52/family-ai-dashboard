# Open Questions

Unresolved items that block or shape ADRs, specs, or the roadmap. Move
resolved items to the bottom with their resolution + date. Seeded at
bootstrap from validation round 1 (`research/validation-round1-2026-06.md`).

## Blocking (gate validation → build)

- **OQ-license:** How should Dayfold be licensed & published? **Researched
  2026-06-25 → Proposed ADR 0032 (awaiting operator + `[pending-counsel]`).**
  Findings: open-source-for-showcase = GO (near-zero opportunity cost); Apache-2.0
  client/CLI/schema + AGPL-3.0 server (not BSL) + G1 brains closed-by-not-publishing;
  monetize via hosted SaaS only; DCO contributions; blocking pre-flight secret scan.
  Report: `research/2026-06-25-licensing-open-source-strategy.md`. Closes ADR 0031's
  license gate on acceptance.
- **OQ-wtp:** Will any non-operator family *pay* for this over free
  incumbents (Gemini Daily Brief / Cozi / Maple)? Only field-provable.
  → feeds A4, A7, Gate G1b, KS-5. **The single product-defining unknown.**
- **OQ-niche:** Is there a defensible high-pain niche (co-parenting/split
  households, special-needs/IEP logistics, eldercare) that horizontal
  incumbents won't serve? → feeds A1, ADR 0004 flip-condition #2, Gate G1b.
- **OQ-gemini-family:** Does Google ship a *free, family-shared* variant of
  Gemini Daily Brief within ~12 months? If yes, the business case is likely
  terminal. → feeds KS-6, ADR 0004 flip-condition #1. Re-check quarterly.
- **OQ-ondevice-casa:** Does on-device-only Gmail processing (no server ever
  sees restricted data) exempt the CASA assessment while still needing
  restricted-scope verification? Architecture-defining if Gmail ingestion is
  ever pursued. → feeds A2, A3, post-MVP Gmail ADR.

## Important, not blocking
- **OQ-web-target** *(NEW 2026-06-28, operator interest)*: Add a **Compose-for-Web
  (`wasmJs`) client**? CLAUDE.md lists Android/iOS/**Web**, but only `androidTarget()`,
  `jvm("desktop")`, and iOS (arm64 + sim) are wired in `apps/client/build.gradle.kts` — no
  `wasmJs` target, web source set, web module, or `index.html` entry exists. **Feasibility
  (investigated + dependency-verified against Maven Central 2026-06-28):**
  1. **No dependency blocker — every wasmJs artifact is PUBLISHED.** Verified each module's
     Gradle `.module` metadata declares `platform.type: "wasm"` (wasmJs*Elements):
     redux-kotlin `1.0.0-alpha03` (all four: `-threadsafe`/`-compose`/`-granular`/
     `-devtools-core`) ✓; `io.ktor:ktor-client-core:3.5.0` ✓; `io.coil-kt.coil3:coil-compose`
     + `coil-network-ktor3:3.2.0` ✓; `app.cash.sqldelight:runtime` + `coroutines-extensions`
     + **`web-worker-driver`** `2.3.2` ✓; kotlin 2.3.20 + Compose 1.11.1 native wasmJs.
     (Correction of an earlier guess: redux-kotlin wasmJs *is* published — only the **iosX64**
     native publication is genuinely missing, a separate gap.)
  2. **6 `expect`/`actual` seams need wasmJs actuals.** The easy five compile straight away:
     `PlatformActions` (`window.open` / `tel:` / `mailto:`) and `QrScanner` /
     `rememberCameraPermissionRequester` / `qrScanSupported` (stub unsupported on web). Plus the
     ktor wasmJs/js engine wiring (Coil), a web entry (`index.html` + `main()` with
     `ComposeViewport`), and a build/deploy path. **`DriverFactory` is the real gate (not a
     stub):** the only web SQLDelight driver is `web-worker-driver`, which is **async**, so it
     requires `generateAsync = true`. But the current DB layer is **synchronous** — no
     `generateAsync` in the `sqldelight {}` block; `ContentStore` uses `.executeAsList()` /
     `.executeAsOneOrNull()`; `DriverFactory.createDriver(): SqlDriver` is sync; and the driver
     is created **eagerly at startup** (desktop `Main.kt`, android `MainActivity`). So a working
     web DB means a **sync→async migration** of `ContentStore` + every caller (SyncEngine /
     HubEngine / the shells' startup) to suspend — which touches **all** shipping platforms
     (Android/desktop/iOS), so it's a deliberate architectural change + its own risk, NOT a
     drop-in actual. (A web build that merely *renders* could stub the driver to throw, but the
     shells construct `ContentStore` at startup → it'd crash before first paint unless that's
     also deferred.) **This async migration is the true effort gate for a functional web client.**
  3. **Design:** the **Expanded** adaptive breakpoint (`designs/content/adaptive/
     Breakpoints.dc.html` + the two-pane content/detail comps + `Settings-Adaptive`) is the
     layout reference. Web-chrome-specific affordances are deliberately unbuilt
     (`DESIGN-BRIEF-content-adaptive.md`: "web is not a build target yet — design desktop as
     the 'expanded' reference; don't design web-chrome-specific affordances"). A *minimal*
     browser build renders the existing Compose UI as-is; anything web-platform-specific
     (browser chrome, URL/deep-link routing, web auth-redirect flow) needs fresh design +
     sign-off (ADR 0008).
  **Decision (operator):** dependencies are all available (no Maven blocker), but a *functional*
  web client is gated on the **SQLDelight sync→async DB migration** (the true effort, touches all
  platforms) — that's the architectural call to make first. Sequence: (1) decide + do the async
  DB migration (its own ADR-ish change), then (2) the wasmJs target + the 5 easy actuals + the
  async `DriverFactory` + web entry (agent-doable), then (3) web-platform-specific UX (design-
  gated, ADR 0008). The non-DB scaffolding (target + 5 actuals + entry, DB deferred) could land
  first to de-risk, but a runnable web app needs step 1.
- **OQ-geocode-claim-wording** *(ADR 0028)*: the exact, legally-defensible
  marketing/UX wording for the location-privacy tiers — especially any
  first-party opt-in geocoding service (T5) "not sold / not shared / not linked
  to your identity / not retained" language. FTC + state privacy laws police
  "we don't sell" against actual data flows. **Counsel-gated before any
  external launch.** Structural tiers (T1–T4) need no such promise. → ADR 0028
  §Honest-claim, `[pending-counsel]`.
- **OQ-geocode-cpra-reading** *(ADR 0028)*: confirm the reading that an
  *authored venue coordinate* falls **outside** CPRA "precise geolocation" SPI
  (the statutory def is data "derived from a device…to locate a consumer", not
  a referenced place) — and the Apple/Play app-store-label conclusions for
  author-time/transient geocoding. Reasoning, not settled law → **privacy
  attorney to confirm before external launch.** → ADR 0028.

- **OQ-card-actions:** External card deep-links (the value-prop "[list]"→
  Instacart / "[reply]"→mail) have no structured home — `target` is
  internal-nav-only, `actions[]` is ADR 0016 2-way-reserved. M0 ships them as
  allowlisted **markdown links in `body_md`**; decide whether a structured
  external action layer (`links[]`, distinct from 2-way `actions[]`) is worth
  it before the action surface matters for WTP. → `specs/prototype/12-briefing-
  card-spec.md`.

- **OQ-e2e-encryption:** Adopt end-to-end encryption (CLI encrypts → server
  stores blind → device decrypts)? Feasible because the server never processes
  content. Crux = family-content-key distribution across the multi-member +
  invite + device-grant flows; cost = loses server-side FTS + adds key-loss
  recovery. → `backlog/next.md` TASK-E2E + `research/e2e-encryption-
  investigation.md`. ADR-class.
- **OQ-auth-recovery-floor:** passwordless last-resort recovery (all linked
  methods lost) + its abuse surface. → ADR 0011 / C4 security model.
- **OQ-family-switcher:** family-switcher UX when the multi-family UI ships
  (M:N model is built; UI is single-family at MVP). → ADR 0011.
- **OQ-invite-roles:** can a non-owner adult invite members? Default
  owner-only at MVP. → `specs/auth-and-family-design.md`.
- **OQ-markdown-render** *(M0 shipped 2026-06-26; full-fidelity deferred)*: the
  2026-06-18 plan was `mikepenz/multiplatform-markdown-renderer` (+`-coil3`).
  **What actually shipped (M0) is a hand-rolled `renderBlockMarkdown`**
  (`CardRender.kt`, no dependency) → `AnnotatedString` covering **bold/italic,
  bullet + checkbox + ordered lists, tables, ATX headings (`#`/`##`), and the
  scheme-allowlisted `[label](url)` links** — used by both hub blocks (PR #114/
  #115/#120) and feed cards (#119). XSS-safe via the shared `ALLOWED_SCHEMES`
  allowlist (same seam as cards). Surfaced + driven by the first real CLI-authored
  hub. **Images still off** (need async, host-gated loading). Adopt `mikepenz` only
  if/when full CommonMark fidelity (nested lists, autolink, raw HTML, images) is
  worth the dep. → `specs/event-hubs-design.md` §Markdown.
- **OQ-hub-collab:** At MVP, is Hub authoring push/Claude-only, or can family
  members edit Hubs in-app? (Lean: push-only at MVP, in-app edit post-MVP.)
  → feeds `specs/event-hubs-design.md`, C1b.
- **OQ-hub-archival:** Retention + export policy for archived Hubs. **Narrowed
  2026-06-23:** delete-on-request (Guardrail 4) is now covered by the MVP **manual
  hard-purge tool** (operator-chosen, schema review); what remains here is the
  *auto*-retention/export policy (auto-TTL stays OUT at MVP). → C4.
- **OQ-now-emission** *(NEW 2026-06-23, schema review)*: Does **Hub → "Now"**
  card emission stay **manual** (the Claude skill pulls hubs + authors imminent-
  item cards — the MVP choice) or gain a **server-side cron / hybrid deriver**
  post-MVP? MVP = manual, no server logic. → `specs/domain-model/scope-and-access-
  model.md` §7.
- **OQ-hub-created-by** *(NEW 2026-06-23 → decided same day by ADR 0030 round-1
  review)*: Hubs (and cards) get a resolved-`user_id` `created_by` column —
  resolving authorship through child-block `provenance` fails closed on credential
  deletion / zero-block hubs. **Decided: add it.** Kept here only as a build-task
  pointer. → content-slice build.
- **OQ-doc-storage:** When do we add real document upload + its privacy tier
  (vs links + small refs at MVP)? → ADR 0006 revisit, C4.
- **OQ-minor-age-gate:** Is a self-attested age gate sufficient for 14+
  minor accounts given no restricted/email data, and does the app trip the
  Maryland Kids Code DPIA trigger? → gates ADR 0005 acceptance. Counsel
  confirm (operator-gated).
- **OQ-casa-tier:** Exact CASA tier (2 vs 3) + current assessor fee for the
  Gmail restricted scope — only relevant once/if direct Gmail is pursued.
- **OQ-familylink-oauth:** Live Family Link supervised-account behavior —
  does Google block a restricted-scope OAuth grant? Build-time spike (A3)
  firms the one partially-confirmed compliance claim.
- **OQ-instacart-reopen:** Has Instacart's Developer Platform reopened to new
  applicants? Currently closed. Walmart add-to-cart URL is the fallback.
- **OQ-price-cadence:** Final price + cadence (recommend annual ~$39-59/yr).
  ADR-class, operator-gated. → feeds B6.
- **OQ-store-commission:** Does App Store/Play 15-30% commission apply to the
  billing model? Hits margin harder than LLM cost. → feeds A5.
- **OQ-cmp-web:** Is CMP Web (Wasm) Stable yet at build-decision time?
  Currently Beta — treat web as early-adopter.
- **OQ-action-revenue:** Can the deep-link action layer earn affiliate/
  referral revenue (ADR 0004 flip-condition #3)? Most consumer affiliate
  programs pay pennies and need volume.

## Deferred by design (prototype scope — ADR 0007)

Tracked, not gaps. Each re-enters via its own ADR/spec when the prototype
earns the next build (per ADR 0007 revisit trigger):

- Push notifications / FCM + APNs (needs Apple Dev $99/yr + Firebase). [review-gap G1]
- Multi-member login / household tenancy / roles. [review-gap G2]
- Data-source integrations: native EventKit/CalendarContract (no-OAuth path)
  or Google Calendar API (sensitive scope); Gmail/weather/commerce. [N4]
- Universal Links / App Links + `assetlinks.json` / `apple-app-site-
  association` (zero-redirect, iOS CDN ~24h). [N1/N2]
- Home-screen widget (Glance + WidgetKit — native-only, 2× UI). [N5]
- Document upload/storage + privacy tier (MVP = links + small refs). [OQ-doc-storage]

New prototype-level open items:
- **OQ-proto-auth:** exact single-household token mechanism (issue/rotate/scope)
  for the prototype. Minimal, not a login system. → A3.
- **OQ-ios-deploy:** Apple account for on-device iOS — free 7-day re-sign vs
  $99/yr stable. Decide before A3 device testing.
- **OQ-account-resurrection** *(2026-06-25, data-rights audit)*: After
  `DELETE /auth/me` soft-deletes a user (`users.deleted_at` set, memberships
  → `removed`, credentials revoked), a re-sign-in with the SAME identity mints a
  fresh, valid session — `findOrCreateUser` (`apps/api/src/auth/identity.ts:91-95`)
  matches the surviving `user_identities` row and returns the soft-deleted
  `user_id` with **no `deleted_at` check**, so `/auth/firebase` + `/auth/dev-token`
  issue tokens. But `/auth/me` (`app.ts:177`) and `/auth/me/export` (`:208`) filter
  `deleted_at IS NULL` and 401, so the session is a broken half-state (authed by
  token, invisible to whoami). No data leak today — it just can't reach `/auth/me`.
  **Decision needed** (guardrail #4 — honor delete, no dark-pattern retention): on
  re-sign-in to a soft-deleted account, (a) **resurrect** — clear `deleted_at`
  (easiest UX, but re-activates a deleted account — arguably anti-delete); (b)
  **reject** until the purge job runs (respects delete; the identity can't
  re-register in the window); or (c) **fresh account** — reassign the identity to a
  new `user_id` (must handle the `UNIQUE(provider, provider_uid)` constraint).
  ADR-class (customer-data handling) → resolve before any account-deletion UX ships.

## Resolved

- **OQ-owner-visibility-default** *(2026-06-23, INB-21)*: Does `role=owner`
  auto-read `restricted` hubs? **Resolved: A — owner NOT auto-permitted** (reads
  only as author or via allow-list; protects co-parent/eldercare privacy).
  Recorded in ADR 0030 (Accepted). Flip to owner-sees-all / audited break-glass =
  a superseding ADR.
- **OQ-card-vs-hub-posture** *(2026-06-23, INB-21)*: Is "a card can't out-expose
  its hub" server-enforced or author-trusted at MVP? **Resolved: A —
  author-trusted** (skill stamps card audience; no server intersection).
  Server enforcement re-enters when multi-author/in-app authoring lands (ADR 0030
  Revisit Trigger).
- **review-gap G3 — per-Hub / per-member visibility** *(2026-06-23, schema
  review)*: Moved from "Deferred by design" **into MVP**. Operator chose per-hub
  visibility at MVP; resolved by **ADR 0030** (`family`|`restricted` + allow-list,
  read-path filter, shares ADR 0029's resource model). Builds with the content-API
  slice. Residual values-shaped sub-question → OQ-owner-visibility-default (above).
- **OQ-now-scope** *(2026-06-23, schema review)*: Is "Now" a subscription query
  over subscribed Hubs, or self-contained? **Resolved: self-contained, own table
  (`briefing_cards`).** Not a live query; coupled to Hubs by one-way reference
  edges only (deep-link out; manual CLI-authored cards in). →
  `specs/domain-model/scope-and-access-model.md` §2/§7.
- **OQ-child-accounts** *(2026-06-18)*: Can children have their own logins
  reading their own Gmail? **No — structurally blocked** by Google's
  supervised-account architecture (under-13s can't self-grant restricted
  OAuth) on top of COPPA. Resolution: **adults-only accounts at MVP, parent
  as data controller** (ADR 0004). Re-opening requires a new ADR.
- **OQ-llm-cost** *(2026-06-18)*: Is LLM cost a viability threat? **No** —
  ~$0.02-0.54/family/mo; 78-91% contribution margin. Acquisition/retention
  is the real constraint, not cost.
- **OQ-block-payload-schema** *(2026-06-26, authoring-doc review)*: The hub-**block**
  `payload` shape **diverges** between the client render model
  (`apps/client/.../Model.kt` `BlockPayload`) and the generated content schema
  (`packages/schema/kotlin-gen/Content.kt`, from `content.schema.json`). The server
  stores `payload` as JSONB **verbatim** (passthrough — `content/hubs.ts`), so the
  *render* contract is the client model: `items[{text,done,due,assignee}]`,
  `url`/`label`/`domain`/`docRef`, `name`/`role`/`phone`/`email`, `address`/`lat`/`lng`,
  `date`, `total`/`spent`. The schema instead names `ref`/`source`/`kind`/`mapUrl`
  and a richer `Item` (`amount`/`label`/`paid`). **Impact:** a structured block authored
  per the *schema* (e.g. `document.ref`, `location.mapUrl`, `budget` via item `amount`)
  silently won't render; `body_md` markdown is unaffected. **Not yet hit** (live content
  is `body_md`-only). **Action:** reconcile the two to one source of truth (likely
  regenerate/realign `content.schema.json` ↔ client model) before structured-payload
  authoring is relied on; until then authors use the client-model field names (now in
  `apps/cli/templates/README.md`) or `body_md`. → **ADR 0035 (Accepted 2026-06-26)**
  → on implementation, adopted **Option C** (the schema is **frozen + well-designed**,
  there's no Kotlin codegen, and the renderer needs fields the schema lacks, so the
  original Option A was wrong). **Done (M0):** block-payload validation in the CLI
  `validateHubTree` (#144) + the server (#145, also fixing the `BlockSchema.payload =
  z.any()` codegen stub), renderer reads canonical schema names alongside client ones
  (#146), authoring doc marks the schema canonical. **Residual (M1):** collapse to ONE
  representation (rename client → schema, decide location `lat/lng` vs `mapUrl` + budget
  itemized vs summary, build Kotlin codegen) — until then both names are accepted.
- **OQ-feed-empty-state** *(2026-06-26, dogfood review)*: An **established** family with
  **no briefing cards** sees the feed render `FamilyNullState` ("Your family space is
  ready · Invite a member · connect a device") — the **onboarding** state — because
  `FeedScreen` shows it for *any* empty `state.cards` (not syncing/error). For a family
  that already has hubs/members and is simply caught up, this misframes "no briefing
  right now" as "nothing set up yet." Surfaced dogfooding the operator's own account
  (a hub authored, zero cards). **Design-gated (ADR 0008):** the fix is a calm
  "you're all caught up / nothing needs you right now" empty state (optionally linking
  to hubs), distinct from first-run onboarding — needs a hi-fi mockup + operator
  sign-off before build. Distinguisher is also non-trivial on the feed (hubs/members
  aren't loaded there yet), so the design should decide the signal too. Low urgency
  (cosmetic; no data risk). → **Design brief authored**:
  `designs/DESIGN-BRIEF-feed-empty-states.md` (4 posture states + the
  new-vs-established signal). → **Hi-fi comp authored + rendered (light+dark)**:
  `designs/Family AI dashboard design brief/designs/States-Feed.dc.html` (caught-up,
  first-run, syncing, offline; recommends `established = hubs.isNotEmpty() ||
  members.size > 1`, with the `familyHasContent`-on-sync variant; includes the
  M3→FeedScreen mapping). → **Built 2026-06-27 (#209)**: operator signed off; FeedScreen
  now routes its empty branch into the four posture states keyed on the recommended signal
  `established = state.hubs.isNotEmpty() || state.members.size > 1` (both already on the Now
  surface — SyncEngine watches `activeHubsFlow`, roster loads at session). All four states
  snapshotted (light+dark) with the misframing branch-logic + the caught-up→Hubs forward-path
  nav tested (#210/#211). **Fully resolved.**
