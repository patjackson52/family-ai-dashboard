## Concept

An **Event Hub** is one typed, AI-curated dossier for a family event —
everything in one place: info, links, documents, checklists, timeline,
contacts. Persistent (lives until the event passes, then archives). Rich and
sectioned. It is the **"Projects"** peer of the daily **"Now"** briefing.

Why it matters: validation round 1 found the daily-briefing concept
commoditized (Gemini Daily Brief / Cozi / Maple). Event Hubs are **not**
shipped by those incumbents and lean directly into the content-API /
power-user wedge — this is the candidate **defensible surface** the
validation said was missing. See `research/validation-round1-2026-06.md`.

## Two surfaces, one data model (equal peers)

- **Now (briefing):** ephemeral cards — next action, today's logistics.
  Each card **deep-links into the relevant Hub**.
- **Hub (project):** persistent dossier. Imminent Hub items (checklist due,
  countdown, milestone) **emit briefing cards** into Now.

One store, two views. The coupling is the product: Now answers "what next?",
Hub answers "everything about it." The tap from Now into the exact Hub
content is the load-bearing interaction — see **Deep-linking** below.

## Data model (JSON schema = source of truth)

```
Hub {
  id, type (from template catalog), title, status (planning|active|archived),
  dates: { start?, end?, countdownTo? }
  sections: Section[]
}
Section { id, title, order, blocks: Block[] }
Block (typed; discriminated union):
  - text        { markdown }
  - link        { url, label, source }
  - checklist   { items: [{ text, done, due?, assignee? }] }
  - document    { ref: url | fileRef, label, kind }      // MVP: link + small file ref
  - milestone   { date, label }
  - contact     { name, role, phone?, email? }
  - location    { label, address?, mapUrl? }
  - budget      { items: [{ label, amount, paid? }] }     // optional, post-MVP candidate
provenance (per block): { source: "claude" | "email" | "user" | "<url>", at }
```

Schemas live in `specs/domain-model/schemas/` once this is gate-promoted
(borrowing ambient-ai's "schema wins over prose" discipline).

## Template catalog (bounded — ADR 0004 "template-catalog-bounded")

Starter Hub types, each = default sections + checklist skeleton:
`vacation`, `starting-college`, `move`, `party-event`, `new-baby`,
`medical`, `school-year`. Bounded catalog keeps curation scoped and review-
able; new types are added deliberately, not inferred open-endedly.

## Curation = push-based, external ("render, don't reason")

AI curation runs **outside** the app — Claude Code, AI loops, scheduled
tasks — and **pushes** assembled blocks to the content API. The app stores
and renders; it does not run open-ended ingestion/curation at MVP. App-side
source ingestion (auto-pull from Calendar/email) is **post-MVP** and ADR-
gated. This keeps the MVP true to the content-API wedge and the
restricted-scope/COPPA avoidance in ADR 0004/0005.

**Provenance on every block** (constitution honesty guarantee): each block
shows where it came from ("added by Claude", "from your email", "link you
saved"). The product never presents fabricated content as fact.

## Power-user authoring flow

The app **owns and stores** the rendered content (single render source of
truth). Power users may keep their **own upstream source** (git repo,
laptop notes, scraped data) and instruct Claude to push into the platform:

1. Power user maintains rich source anywhere they like.
2. Runs Claude Code with the family-ai-dashboard skill → transforms source
   into Hub/Section/Block payloads → **idempotent upsert** via the content
   API (auth token; re-push = update, never duplicate).
3. App stores + renders to every family member, including non-technical
   members who only ever see the finished page.

The app does **not** read the user's repo; the flow is push-only. Stable
block IDs + upsert semantics make re-curation safe and repeatable.

## Content API (extends the MVP content API)

- `PUT /hubs/{id}` — upsert hub (idempotent on id).
- `PUT /hubs/{id}/sections/{sid}` / `.../blocks/{bid}` — upsert section/block.
- `POST /hubs/{id}/archive` — archive after event passes.
- Auth: per-household API token (power user / loop). Rate-limited per token.
- CLI + Claude skill wrap these; payloads validate against the JSON schema.

## Deep-linking: briefing → Hub content

The load-bearing interaction: a user taps a briefing card and lands on the
**exact** Hub content it refers to — a header, checklist item, link, or
document — not just the Hub top.

**Addressing.** Every Section and Block has a stable id (upsert-stable).
A briefing card carries a `target`:

```
BriefingCard.target = { hubId, sectionId?, blockId? }
```

Cards *emitted from* a Hub item already know their origin block, so the
backlink is free; cards authored independently set the deepest target they
can resolve.

**One canonical link, all surfaces (universal / app links).**
- **Web:** `https://<app>/hubs/{hubId}#block-{blockId}` — real anchor.
- **Native (Android/iOS):** the same https URL via **Android App Links /
  iOS Universal Links** opens the app; fallback custom scheme
  `familyai://hub/{hubId}?block={blockId}`.
- **CMP shared route:** `HubRoute(hubId, focusBlockId?)` renders the Hub,
  scrolls to the target, **transiently highlights** it, and expands its
  section.

**Graceful resolution (never dead-end).** If the target block/section is
missing (archived, deleted, not yet pushed), resolve to the nearest
ancestor (block → section → hub top) and show a quiet "that item moved"
note. A deep link never lands on an error.

**Arrival behavior = calm.** Scroll + transient highlight + expand the
section. The app does **not** auto-navigate out. For a **document block**
(MVP = link + small file ref), the deep link lands *focused on the block*;
the user taps to open the external ref. (Confirmed MVP behavior — no
auto-open, no in-app preview yet; full in-app document preview is post-MVP
and ADR-0006-revisit-gated.)

**Provenance back-link (optional, low priority).** A block may show
"surfaced in your briefing" — the inverse of the card's `target`.

## Native vs www

CMP shared composables render the same Hub data per-surface:
- **Mobile (Android/iOS):** scrollable, collapsible sectioned page; imminent
  items pinned; countdown header.
- **Web (Wasm/JS, early-adopter per CMP-Web Beta):** richer multi-column /
  board layout; same data, denser presentation.

## Documents at MVP

**Links + small file refs only.** Hubs hold URLs and lightweight file
references; no heavy upload/storage pipeline at MVP. Full document upload +
storage + a dedicated privacy/security tier is **post-MVP** (feeds C4
security model). Keeps dogfood sensitivity and cost low.

## Scope, privacy, and gate notes

- **Scope expansion → Proposed ADR 0006.** Hosting curated dossiers +
  checklists is beyond "render ephemeral briefing cards." A Hub is a
  **derived, curated dossier the app owns** — it points into the family's
  calendar/email/lists, it does **not** replace them (reconciles the
  constitution "not a system of record" line). ADR 0006 must be Accepted
  before this is a binding spec.
- **Minor access (ADR 0005, Proposed):** Hubs inherit the strictest data
  posture for 14+ minor profiles; no email-derived blocks on minor profiles.
- **Documents** raise sensitivity even as refs — privacy tiering is a C4 item.

## How this feeds the board

- **C1 PRD v0** — Event Hubs + Now briefing as co-equal surfaces.
- **C2 architecture** — content API + Hub schema + render layer.
- **A3 capability spike** — extend the content-API spike to include a Hub
  upsert round-trip from Claude Code.

## Open questions (also in `context/open-questions.md`)

- OQ-hub-archival: retention/export policy for archived Hubs.
- OQ-hub-collab: can multiple family members edit a Hub in-app, or is
  authoring push/Claude-only at MVP? (Lean: push/Claude-only at MVP, in-app
  edit post-MVP.)
- OQ-doc-storage: when do we add real document upload + its privacy tier?
- OQ-deeplink-domain: Android App Links + iOS Universal Links need a verified
  domain + association files (`assetlinks.json` / `apple-app-site-assoc`) —
  an infra prerequisite for the same https link to open the app. → C2/C3.
